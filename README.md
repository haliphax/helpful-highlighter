Helpful Highlighter
===

Adaptive Excel 2007/2010 AddIn for visually/mentally imparied users that will highlight the current row and column

Installation & Usage
---
After compiling and running the VSTO installation script, Helpful Highlighter options will be available in the *Add-Ins* menu ribbon tab of Excel.

The *Enabled* checkbox does just what you would expect it to; it toggles the Add-In's functionality. If you get tired of highlighting, just turn it off.

The *Preserve colors* checkbox causes Helpful Highlighter to remember the background colors of cells it highlights. This is marginally slower than the alternative, and causes only the visible area to be highlighted. Unchecked, highlighted rows and columns will stretch to infinity (and beyond!).
